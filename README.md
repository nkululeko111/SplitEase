# SplitEase – Ultimate Bill Splitting Solution

SplitEase is a revolutionary mobile app that eliminates the hassle of post-meal reimbursements by enabling group payments **before** the meal ends. With restaurant integration, real-time order tracking, and a shared digital wallet, SplitEase makes dining out with friends seamless and fun.

## 🚀 Core Concept: "Pay-As-You-Order"

Everyone contributes to a shared wallet before the meal concludes. Restaurants upload their menus, and the entire payment process is handled via a single **QR code scan**.
